The main purpose of this project is to predict safe drivable regions of the roads or semantic segmentation of the roads on which the vehicle drives. For drivable regions prediction , video live streaming through the front camera is the only source of data
to be processed. In this regard, camera frames of live road video play an important role. The live road frames can be processed through deep learning techniques to recognize the road, pedestrians,
cars, cyclists, sidewalks, etc at a pixel-level accuracy.

Accurate real-time visual signal processing to create pixel-wise classed pictures, also known as semantic segmentation, is critical for scenario comprehension.

Semantic Segmentation is used in autonomous vehicles to identify these objects on the roads. Sometimes semantic segmentation is referred to as “pixel-wise classification.”
